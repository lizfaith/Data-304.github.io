From Professor Bailey:
The most interesting thing I learned was the importance of creating a narrative with data. He emphasized that a wellâ€“designed dashboard not only presents the information but also tells a story guiding the viewer through key insights in a compelling way.


From Prof VanHorn:
He pointed out how GIS can help us improve our world. We can make decisions on the most efficient way to construct infrastructure and transportation. He demonstrated a lot of practical ways in which GIS can be used to impact the environment positively.
